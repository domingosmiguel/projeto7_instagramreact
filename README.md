# **Project 7: InstagramReact**

The objective with this project was to have a contact with ReactJS technology by adapting a previous project to React's way of writing apps plus a bonus. A more interactive and WebApp-like page.

## **Exercised Contents**:

-   React props
-   Destructuring assignment
-   React Hook (useState)

## **Results**:

It is a simple project, much simpler than others we made so far, but it was really nice to go back and see how much I learned up to this point. We have interactive buttons to like and save post, count of likes that is updated accordingly, possibility to change image and username.

To show the result, the application was posted on [Vercel](https://instagram-react-snowy.vercel.app/)! You can browse it both on pc and mobile.

## **How To Run**:

-   Clone repository
-   Import repository from GitHub to Vercel
-   Deploy

## **Comments**:

It wasn't my first project with ReactJS although it's the first time we've used it in the Driven bootcamp. I used the experience gained so far to evaluate some previous projects and it was really fun to see how I understand React so much better now, just understanding javascript in a much deeper way:

-   Good organization of the code, with the App divided into several components
-   Use of variables and SASS for better code organization
